    # Debugger.start_ -> bool
    # Debugger.start_ { ... } -> bool
    #  
    # This method is internal and activates the debugger. Use
    # Debugger.start (from <tt>lib/ruby-debug-base.rb</tt>) instead.
    # 
    # The return value is the value of !Debugger.started? <i>before</i>
    # issuing the +start+; That is, +true+ is returned, unless debugger
    # was previously started.
    # 
    # If a block is given, it starts debugger and yields to block. When
    # the block is finished executing it stops the debugger with
    # Debugger.stop method. Inside the block you will probably want to
    # have a call to Debugger.debugger. For example:
    #   Debugger.start{debugger; foo}  # Stop inside of foo
    # 
    # Also, ruby-debug only allows
    # one invocation of debugger at a time; nested Debugger.start's
    # have no effect and you can't use this inside the debugger itself.
